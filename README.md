### Project Title: Car detection using OpenCV and Python
#### Overview:
This project demonstrates how to use Python and OpenCV to detect cars in a live video stream and estimate their speed based on object tracking.

#### Features:
- Car detection using Haar Cascade Classifier
- Object tracking to estimate car speed
- Live video feed with marked car speeds

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yevano09/cardetction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scipy
```

#### Usage:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python car_speed_estimation.py
```
1. The live video feed will open, showing detected cars with their estimated speeds marked on the screen.
2. Press 'q' to exit the video feed.
